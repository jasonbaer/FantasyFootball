Just me, messing around with R to draft the best fantasy football team possible.

Attempting to teach myself R... I needed to find some data that was interesting enough to hold my interest, but also something that I was familiar with so that I didn't spend all my time wondering if the outcomes were right. I've always wanted to absolutely crush in the office fantasy league, this seemed like a win-win.

I first came across this post from Huey, https://goo.gl/6fa6n6. Then I read through this article by Boris Chen, https://goo.gl/Jr99pH, which is what inspired Huey. I started with Boris' code which I found on github here, https://github.com/borisachen/fftiers. Basically, I took it apart and stepped through it line by line so that I could comprehend what was happening. I also took a look at what Huey had done, his repo is avaiable at https://github.com/hueykwik/FantasyFootball.
